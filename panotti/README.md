This directory holds the actual "panotti library" itself, if you will. 

Everything else in other directories are add-on utilities built upon the library.

*Note that the multi_gpu.py code is a slightly-modified version of original by kuza55: https://github.com/kuza55/keras-extras/blob/master/utils/multi_gpu.py*
